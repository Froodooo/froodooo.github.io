A manager asks one of his employees to come into his office. The numbers of this employee are down for the second quarter in a row.

Manager A: "Your numbers are down, what are you going to do about it?"  
Manager B: "Your numbers are down, are you OK?"

Notice the difference in empathy. The first manager has no empathy at all and only cares about company success. The second manager's first priority is empathy and the wellbeing of his employees. He knows that all success originates from there.

Be empathic.
