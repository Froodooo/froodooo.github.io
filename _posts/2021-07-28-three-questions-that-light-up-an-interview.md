Hiring new software developers can be a challenge. What do you look for in a candidate? Technical skills are important. And what about the cultural fit? And the ability to work together with other people? There are quite some things to be aware of that make the interview process non-trivial.

Above all, when interviewing someone, I want it to be a casual conversation. A conversation you would have on a Friday afternoon, with some food and drinks. A conversation that is - in some way - informal. But, questions can help to (re)start a conversation that's stuck. So I'm always on the lookout for inspiring questions I can use during interviews.

Here are three questions I recently found online that I'm eager to try out soon:
1. **What do you want to do differently in your next role?**
A question that can give insight about the direction someone is thinking towards. Does someone look back to the job they once had, or do they look forward to the job they want to have?
2. **What motivates you to work?**
A question that taps into the intrinsic motivation of a person. What fires this person up, what is the real motivator in life?
3. **What are some things outside of work that youâ€™re irrationally passionate about?**
A question that could be a follow-up or replacement of the previous question. It can help to figure out what drives a person and if the job is a fit.
