<div id="content"><p>The 4 goal types:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Vision  </li>
<li>Long-term  </li>
<li>Medium-term  </li>
<li>Short-term  </li>
</ul>

<p>Looking at this list from the bottom up, goals at the bottom of the list should always support goals higher up the list (in one way or another).  </p>

<p>"You cannot coach someone towards goals that they don't have."  </p>

<hr />

<p>How would you like to be remembered? What do you want to be written on your gravestone?  </p>

<p>50 Questions for Finding Your Client's Passion &amp; Purpose in Life (see PDF in course)  </p>

<ul>
<li>These can also be used as questions in coaching sessions.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Goal setting process:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Stage 1: Getting a vision for life  </li>
<li>Stage 2: Knowing what you want  </li>
<li>Stage 3: Defining your future goals  </li>
<li>Stage 4: Preparing an action plan  </li>
<li>Stage 5: Review, adapt &amp; adjust  </li>
</ul>

<p>Goal-setting frameworks:  </p>

<ul>
<li>SMART  </li>
<li>Eisenhower Decision Matrix  </li>
<li>Focus on the important things first, then on the urgent things.  </li>
<li>Important things are often what <strong>you</strong> want, urgent things are often what <strong>others</strong> want.  </li>
<li>Goal Efficiency Matrix  </li>
<li>Skilled Helper Model (Gerard Egan)  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you're in your "element", you're combining something you enjoy with something you're (naturally) good at.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"To find your passion in life you’ve got to first become familiar with yourself. You need to know what drives you, what you’re naturally good at, what you genuinely enjoy, what inspires you, what excites you, what scares you, what you pretend to like, and what lies you’re telling yourself about your skills, natural talents, abilities and gifts."  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It has been said that the two most important days we have in life are the day we are born, and the day we discover why we were born."  </p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Use mind-mapping as a tool to get everything that's inside your head outside your head.  </p>

<p>Mind-mapping can be used by yourself as well as by the people you're coaching (even during sessions).  </p>

<hr />

<p>It's sometimes easier to assist and help other people in their lives than it is to assist and help yourself and your own life (because that's harder and more confrontational for you).</p>
