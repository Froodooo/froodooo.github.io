<div id="content"><ol>
<li><strong>The mind and body affect each other</strong><br />
Your physical condition can affect your mental condition, and vice versa, in the worst case entering a vicious circle.</li>
<li><strong>Every behaviour has a positive intention</strong><br />
Who would we be to judge what other people's intentions are? We have one gage to judge ourselves and another to judge other people. Be cautious when judging people's behaviour; find their intentions instead by asking (better) questions.</li>
<li><strong>Behaviour is geared towards adaptation</strong><br />
People try to adapt and fit into a group. Potentially losing (part of) their authenticity in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Accept the person; encourage changes in attitude and behaviour</strong><br />
A person's behaviour is not the person. Behaviour can change. Separate a person from his actions.</li>
<li><strong>There's no such thing as failure, only feedback to be received</strong><br />
When you stop trying after a failure, you block your ability to learn. Learn through experience.</li>
<li><strong>Respect for the other person's model of the world (even if you don't understand it)</strong><br />
As a life coach, it's not your job to form an opinion. You should stay neutral. Only from neutrality you can ask questions and understand a person's perspective.</li>
<li><strong>There are no bad people, just unhelpful attitudes, habits and behaviours</strong><br />
No one wakes up with the goal of offending someone. But it might happen regardless. Who are we to judge?</li>
