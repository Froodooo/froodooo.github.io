<div id="content"><p>We consume a lot, but we fail to use it. The brain is for <em>having</em> ideas, we need something else to store them. We need a <a href="/garden/second-brain">Second Brain</a>, so that our actual brain can keep its focus on creativity.</p>

<p>This extra brain should be linking things together instead of consisting of silos.</p>

<p>Steps to build a second brain:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Remember</strong><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Think about what you want to remember. Make curated choices. The outcome of this could be your main index.</li><br />
<li>The <a href="/garden/para">PARA</a> system organizes information by "when" you would like to see it next, instead of organization by category.</li><br />
</ol></li>
<li><em>*Connect</em><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Reading about topic A could lead to insights in topic B. Without having that goal before reading.</li><br />
<li>Summarizing and organizing happen in small steps over time. Progressively summarize notes (summary of summary). Organize and add value to a note every time you touch it.</li><br />
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Create</strong><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Use your second brain as basis for creation. For example, to write an article. Stand on the shoulders of giants.</li><br />
<li>Information only becomes knowlege when you use it.</li><br />
<li>It's never a good time to start, so just start. Work incrementally and improve.</li><br />
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Anything you consume can be put to use anywhere, sometimes in unexpected places.</p>
