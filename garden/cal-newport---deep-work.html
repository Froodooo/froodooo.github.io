<ul>
<li>Definiton of <a href="/garden/deep-work">Deep Work</a>:<br />
"Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate."</li>
<li>In other words: pure focus on a single activity for a set amount of time, blocking out all possible distractions.</li>
<li>Also seen (in chapter 1): deep work is "the batching of hard but important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches".</li>
<li>To succeed, you need to be at the best of your capabilities. Something that is only possible with depth, deep work.</li>
<li>Deep work can be considered the superpower of the 21st century.</li>
<li>Interesting to check out: <a href="/garden/bill-gates">Bill Gates</a>'s "Think Weeks" and his written piece "Internet Tidal Wave", and <a href="/garden/neal-stephenson">Neal Stephenson</a>'s <a href="https://www.nealstephenson.com/social-media.html">essay about why he is bad at using social media</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Deep Work Hypothesis</strong>:<br />
"The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingy <em>rare</em> at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly <em>valuable</em> in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive."</li>
<li>Definition of <a href="/garden/shallow-work">Shallow Work</a>:<br />
"Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate."</li>
<li>In other words: activities that can be done without focus, where distractions are non-destructive for the final outcome.</li>
<li>When you spend too much time in "shallowness", it can <em>permanently</em> reduce your ability to do deep work.</li>
<li>You want to minimize the shallow in your life and make most out of the time this frees up.</li>
<li>This can have non-professional benefits as well. For example, you can decide to not touch a computer between the time you get home from work and the next morning when the workday begins. At least not for work-related tasks (because you could still use it for writing a blog post). This gives more time for other important things, like being present with your loved ones. Ultimately, it might even get you comfortable being bored.</li>
<li>Interesting to check out: <a href="/garden/nicholas-carr">Nicholas Carr</a>'s book "The Shallows".</li>

<h1 id="part-1-the-idea">Part 1: The Idea</h1>

<h2 id="chapter-one-deep-work-is-valuable">Chapter One: Deep Work Is Valuable</h2>

<p>There are three groups of people that thrive in the current economy: the High-Skilled Workers, the Superstars and the Owners.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>High-Skilled Workers</strong>:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Working with intelligent machines and new technology.</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Superstars</strong>:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>The best of the best in their profession.</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Owners</strong>:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Investors (people with access to capital) in times when rewards are returned proportional to the input.</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>There are two core abilities to thrive in the new (current) economy (based on the High-Skilled Workers and Superstars):<br />
<ol><br />
<li>the ability to quickly master hard things</li><br />
<li>the ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.<br /><br />
Mastering a skill is not enough, you need to put it to good use as well in order to be successful.</li><br />
</ol></li>
<li>Both abilities described above depend on your ability to perform deep work.</li>
<li>Deliberate practice (really learning something requires deep work, intense focus and no distraction):<br />
<ol><br />
<li>Your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you're trying to improve or an idea you're trying to master.</li><br />
<li>You receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it's most productive.</li><br />
</ol></li>
<li>Plan deep work for yourself. For example: put on an out-of-office reply, even if you're actually in the office and colleagues can shout: "You're not out of office, I see you in your office right now!".</li>
<li>The formula of high-quality work: <code>High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) * (Intensity of Focus)</code>.</li>
<li>Switching between tasks is killing deep work. Switching from Task A to Task B will always leave some residue at the original Task A. This explains why the formula of high-quality work (see above) is true.</li>
<li>There are exceptions to people who are thriving with shallow work. That's mostly CEOs (the book gives an example of Jack Dorsey, who was CEO of Twitter). It's better to hire three smart people to think about a problem, propose solutions and let the CEO decide, instead of letting the CEO do the deep thinking.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-two-deep-work-is-rare">Chapter Two: Deep Work Is Rare</h2>

<ul>
<li>While open offices promote collaboration, they are disastrous for focus and lead to massive distraction. In other words: the advantages of something like an open office are outweighed by its disadvantages.</li>
<li>Depth-destroying behaviors are hard to measure, falling into the <strong>metric black hole</strong>.</li>
<li>With no clear goals on the long term, businesses could fall back on goals for the shorm term and something that's called the <strong>Principle of Least Resistance</strong>:<br />
"In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend towards behaviors that are easiest in the moment."</li>
<li>Businesses are geared towards a <strong>culture of connectivity</strong>, where everyone is always connected (sometimes even outside business hours) and expected to respond to emails and other forms of communication quickly. People tend towards this culture because it is easier (see above principle).</li>
<li>In such a culture of connectivity, it feels like you're being busy and productive, although you're actually not. It's <strong>Busyness as Proxy for Productivity</strong>:<br />
"In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner."</li>
<li>Quoted: "If you're not visibly busy, I'll assume you're not productive." (said by Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer). Horrible.</li>
<li>Concluded: "Deep work <em>should</em> be a priority in today's business climate. But it's not."</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chapter-three-deep-work-is-meaningful">Chapter Three: Deep Work Is Meaningful</h2>

<ul>
<li>Deep work can create as much satisfaction in an information economy as it can in a craft economy, based on three perspectives: neurological, psychological and philosophical:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><strong>Neurological</strong><br /><br />
<ul><br /><br />
<li>"Like fingers pointing to the moon, other diverse disciplines from anthropology to education, behavioral economics to family counseling, similarly suggest that the skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience."</li><br /><br />
<li>Our brains construct our view of the world based on what we pay attention to, not to what actually happens. If your make sure your view of the world is positive, you can improve your world without changing anything concrete about it.</li><br /><br />
</ul></li><br />
<li><strong>Psychological</strong><br /><br />
<ul><br /><br />
<li>"Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one's work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed."</li><br /><br />
<li>People are at their best when immersed deeply in something challenging.</li><br /><br />
</ul></li><br />
<li><strong>Philosophical</strong><br /><br />
<ul><br /><br />
<li>There is something sacred in traditional craftmanship. The question is how we can get the same in knowledge work. There are two key observations:<br /><br /><br />
<ol><br /><br /><br />
<li>Any pursuit that supports high levels of skill can also generate a sense of sacredness. Handle your work with respect and care, and you can generate meaning in your professional life.</li><br /><br /><br />
<li>Cultivating craftmanship is necessarily a deep task and therefore requires a commitment to deep work.</li><br /><br /><br />
</ol></li><br /><br />
</ul></li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>A deep life is a good life, any way you look at it.</li>
</ul>
