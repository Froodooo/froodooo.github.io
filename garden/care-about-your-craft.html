  <p>"Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this quote was taken from a programming book, but it's larger than that. I dare say "caring about your craft" is essential. Why would you stay in your job while the thing you actually want lies elsewhere?</p>

<p>The part about "doing it well" is a logical result of caring about your craft. When you do something you like, chances are high that you'll automatically do it well.</p>
