<div id="content"><p>Book tip: Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl</p>

<p>Coaching gives meaning to other people's lives, which in turn gives meaning to the life of the coach himself.</p>

<hr />

<p>In order to be effective as coaching, you just have to be one or two steps ahead (and I would say, either through experience or in the process of accompaniment, e.g. knowing what questions to ask to get to an answer together).</p>

<p>When we learn to take more responsibility for ourselves, we are automatically empowered to overcome any challenge that life throws our way.</p>

<hr />

<ul>
<li>Self-concept: how we see ourselves.</li>
<li>Self-worth: our intrinsic value, the value we place upon ourselves.</li>
<li>Self-esteem: how confident we are of ourselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Authority comes from our life experiences.</p>

<p>You first have to become confident in yourself, before you can confidently help and coach other people.</p>

<hr />

<p>The 'Victim' Drama Triangle</p>

<ul>
<li>The Rescuer</li>
<li>The Persecutor</li>
<li>The Victim</li>
</ul>

<p>You and only you are responsible for your emotions/behavior/success. Avoid getting stuck as a Victim in the Drama Triangle. To avoid this, you need to become aware of yourself. You need to take responsibility for your own life.</p>
