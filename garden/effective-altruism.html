<p><em>"Our ethics are very focused on not doing wrong, rather than doing <strong>more</strong> good. This made sense in a pre-modern world where we didn’t have much power to do good. But today it’s missing the most important part of the picture."</em></p>

<p><em>"Effective altruism is about using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis."</em><br />
