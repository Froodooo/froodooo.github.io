<p>Structure of L&amp;D:</p>

<ul>
<li>Core elements</li>
<li>Dynamic elements</li>
</ul>

<p>Backbone (where the learning people sit in the organization):</p>

<ul>
<li>Centralized functions</li>
<li>Decentralized functions</li>
<li>Hybrid functions</li>
</ul>

<p>Decentralized functions might be a good fit for organizations that teach very technical content.</p>

<ul>
<li>Soft skills are company-wide, hard skills are department-specific.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soft skills over hard skills</p>

<p>Integrate L&amp;D with and connect L&amp;D to business priorities: know the priorities of the organization and base the L&amp;D priorities on it.</p>

<h1 id="optimizing-the-partnership-with-it">Optimizing the Partnership with IT</h1>

<p>Someone should have a vision and be able to make decisions when it comes to L&amp;D in an organization.</p>

<h1 id="learning-needs-analysis-cracking-the-code">Learning-Needs Analysis: Cracking the Code</h1>

<p>Follow-up on learning programs is important. The average of knowledge that is delivered but not applied by learners is 45% (which is quite high).</p>

<p>Learning Needs Analysis in two rounds:</p>

<ul>
<li>Round 1
<ul>
<li>Define the business problem</li>
<li>Identify gaps and solutions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Go/no-go and prioritize</li>
<li>Round 2
<ul>
<li>Gain deeper insight</li>
<li>Define performance objectives</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This analysis system also helps L&amp;D to go from reactive to proactive.</p>
