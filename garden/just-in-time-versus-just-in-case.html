<div id="content"><p>Our education system is built on a <strong>Just In Case</strong> system. Schools learn us about a wide variety of topics, just in case we need it somewhere in the future.</p>

<p>What works better is <strong>Just In Time</strong> learning. Start to learn about something when you know you will need it.</p>
