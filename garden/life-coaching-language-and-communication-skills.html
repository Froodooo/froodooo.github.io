<div id="content"><p>The quality of our communication determines how well we hear and are heard by other people.  </p>

<p>Core conditions of coaching:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Empathy  </li>
<li>Congruence (agreement, harmony)  </li>
<li>Unconditional Positive Regard  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>The Art of Attending People  </p>

<p><strong>Immediacy</strong>: the quality of bringing one into direct and instant involvement with something, giving rise to a sense of urgency or excitement.  </p>

<p>Yoda: "Do or do not. There is no try."  </p>

<hr />

<p>Attending and Immediacy skills:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Repeat what the other person says and reformulate it into a question. Like: "you were correction me..." turned into "correcting?" (with a questioning face).  </li>
<li>Explicitly mention non-verbal behavior, like smiling, thinking, etc. Say what you see.  </li>
<li>Asking to go deeper, by saying things like "such as...", "like what...", "why...", etc.  </li>
<li>Summarizing what the other person said (and offering your interpretations).  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above techniques help to keep a conversation going.  </p>

<hr />

<p>Roadblocks to healthy communications  </p>

<ol>
<li>Ordering, Directing, Commanding  </li>
<li>Warning, Threatening, Admonishing (reprimand firmly)  </li>
<li>Moralizing, Preaching, 'Should do's' and 'Ought to's'  </li>
<li>Advising, Giving Solutions, Suggesting  </li>
<li>Using Logic, Arguing, Over-Intellectualising  </li>
<li>Criticising, Judging, Assuming, Blaming  </li>
<li>Praising, Agreeing, Supporting  </li>
<li>Labelling, Name-Calling, Ridiculing  </li>
<li>Analysing, Interpreting, Diagnosing  </li>
<li>Reassuring, Sympathizing, Consoling (comfort someone) --> Empathise instead  </li>
<li>Questioning, Probing, Interrogating  </li>
<li>Avoiding, Diverting, Ignoring  </li>
</ol>

<p>Summarized, the twelve above points come down to asking questions in a conversation and letting the other person be in control and determine the conversation path.  </p>

<hr />

<p>The four stages of communications  </p>

<ol>
<li>What I mean to say  </li>
<li>What I actually say  </li>
<li>What I hear he says  </li>
<li>What I assume he means</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>All communications should be dialogue by nature. It's a two-person dance, a two-way street.</p>

<p>Core Communication Skills</p>

<ul>
<li>Attending (be present)</li>
<li>Immediacy (mention behavior that you see)</li>
<li>Active listening</li>
<li>Positive outcome focussed (keep your focus forward)</li>
<li>Reflecting back</li>
<li>Non-directed questions (<em>W</em>-questions)</li>
<li>Appropriate silence</li>
</ul>

<p>All that coaching ever needs to be, is defining practical action steps.</p>

<hr />

<p>Three levels of listening</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Internal listening</strong> (listening to ourselves)</li>
<li><strong>Focused listening</strong> (connecting with others)<br />
Use attending and immediacy first to really focus and ground with someone. When that happened, you know better what questions to ask someone.</li>
<li><strong>Global listening</strong><br />
Combining focused listening (what the other person is saying) with internal listening (what you're thinking). Becoming a second set of eyes and ears for someone.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>You do not need to know the answer to all problems. What you do need to know is the process that is required to solve them.</p>

<p><strong>The six step 'no-lose' life coaching method</strong> (a framework for coaching conversations)</p>

<ol>
<li>Define the problem</li>
<li>Brainstorm possible solutions (conversationally)</li>
<li>Honestly evaluate the solutions</li>
<li>Choose the best solution</li>
<li>Plan some possible next action steps<br />
<em>This is the only time when a coach could make suggestions.</em></li>
<li>Choose date for steps to be taken by<br />
<em>Accountability.</em></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>Hierarchy of Ideas (or chunking up and -down)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Chunking up</strong>: greater agreement, look for the real reasons, look for the "why" behind something.</li>
<li><strong>Chunking down</strong>: details and distinctions, give specific examples.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chunking up is going <em>abstract</em>, chunking down is going <em>specific</em>.</p>
