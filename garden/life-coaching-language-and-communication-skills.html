<div id="content"><p>The quality of our communication determines how well we hear and are heard by other people.  </p>

<p>Core conditions of coaching:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Empathy  </li>
<li>Congruence (agreement, harmony)  </li>
<li>Unconditional Positive Regard  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>The Art of Attending People  </p>

<p><strong>Immediacy</strong>: the quality of bringing one into direct and instant involvement with something, giving rise to a sense of urgency or excitement.  </p>

<p>Yoda: "Do or do not. There is no try."  </p>

<hr />

<p>Attending and Immediacy skills:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Repeat what the other person says and reformulate it into a question. Like: "you were correction me..." turned into "correcting?" (with a questioning face).  </li>
<li>Explicitly mention non-verbal behavior, like smiling, thinking, etc. Say what you see.  </li>
<li>Asking to go deeper, by saying things like "such as...", "like what...", "why...", etc.  </li>
<li>Summarizing what the other person said (and offering your interpretations).  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above techniques help to keep a conversation going.  </p>

<hr />

<p>Roadblocks to healthy communications  </p>

<ol>
<li>Ordering, Directing, Commanding  </li>
<li>Warning, Threatening, Admonishing (reprimand firmly)  </li>
<li>Moralizing, Preaching, 'Should do's' and 'Ought to's'  </li>
<li>Advising, Giving Solutions, Suggesting  </li>
<li>Using Logic, Arguing, Over-Intellectualising  </li>
<li>Criticising, Judging, Assuming, Blaming  </li>
<li>Praising, Agreeing, Supporting  </li>
<li>Labelling, Name-Calling, Ridiculing  </li>
<li>Analysing, Interpreting, Diagnosing  </li>
<li>Reassuring, Sympathizing, Consoling (comfort someone) --> Empathise instead  </li>
<li>Questioning, Probing, Interrogating  </li>
<li>Avoiding, Diverting, Ignoring  </li>
</ol>

<p>Summarized, the twelve above points come down to asking questions in a conversation and letting the other person be in control and determine the conversation path.  </p>

<hr />

<p>The four stages of communications  </p>

<ol>
<li>What I mean to say  </li>
<li>What I actually say  </li>
<li>What I hear he says  </li>
<li>What I assume he means</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>All communications should be dialogue by nature. It's a two-person dance.</p>
