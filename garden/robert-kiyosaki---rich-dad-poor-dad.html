<ol>
<li>Avoid working for money. Make money work for you.</li>
<li>Learn the difference between an asset and a liability. Once you know the difference, invest in assets and avoid liabilities.</li>
<li>Do work that teaches you something new, not work that just earns.</li>
</ol>

<p>The "Rich Dad" versus "Poor Dad" personas show different ways of looking at the same thing, in this case money. It's like a famous question from <a href="/garden/tim-ferriss">Tim Ferriss</a>: "What would it look like it were the complete opposite?". That always remains an interesting question and way of seeing things.</p>

<h1 id="how-the-book-changed-me">🍀 How the book changed me</h1>

<p>It made me see that once you've earned money, there are a lot of ways in which you can make the money work for you. Working harder and earning more is not the only way to make more money. So, let money work for you instead of you only working for money.</p>

<h1 id="top-3-quotes">✍️ Top 3 quotes</h1>

<ol>
<li>"The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them."</li>
<li>"Don’t be addicted to money. Work to learn, don’t work for money. Work for knowledge."</li>
<li>"The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind. If it is trained well, it can create enormous wealth."</li>
</ol>
