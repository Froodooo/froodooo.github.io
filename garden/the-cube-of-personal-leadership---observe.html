<div id="content"><p>Feedback can be based on interpretations or observations.</p>

<p>Feedback based on interpretations means that the person who gives the feedback makes assumptions about what he or she sees. And we know: an assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups.</p>

<p>Feedback based on observations can never be false. An observation contains no opinion, no assumption. It contains the truth and nothing more. And it's a lot easier to continue a conversation based on a truth that both parties can agree on.</p>

<p>Give feedback based on observations instead of interpretations.</p>
