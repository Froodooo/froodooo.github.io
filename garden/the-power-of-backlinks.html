title: The Power of Backlinks

<div id="content"><p>A backlink is a link to another page where the current page is mentioned. For example, when file A links to file B, then file B has a backlink to file A.</p>

<p>In an <a href="/garden/obsidian-workflow">Obsidian workflow</a>, you can use this principle to avoid doubly-linked lists. For example, you only have to link to another page from a MOC without the need for an explicit link from the page to the MOC. The link from the page to the MOC is visible inside a backlink.</p>

<p>The only place where doubly-linked lists can be of use is in index files, to have a quick way of traversing back and forth through your index.</p>
