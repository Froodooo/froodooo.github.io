<p>"In life, it's not what we find that dissapoints us the most. It's just when our expectations aren't met."</p>

<p>You need to be fully aware of yourself to understand why you do what you do. Therefore the number one priority of life coaches is to get your own "house" in order. After you've grown yourself, you are able to guide other people through the same process.</p>

<p>When you have a faulty set of core beliefs, it's going to be difficult to achieve any goal. Everyone has more or less the same set of core values. It's the order in which we prioritize them what separates us from each other.</p>

<p>It's not always what we say that makes impact, but how we say it.</p>

<p>We become competent in a skill when we put it into practice. Practice makes us permanently better than what we've ever been.</p>

<p>Ideas are built upon ideas, knowledge is built upon knowledge.</p>

<p>Life coaches are facilitators of change. </p>

<p>A good life coach teaches its clients how to take responsibility for themselves. Clients should not become dependent on their life coach.</p>

<p>When people take ownership of their lifes, they are able to make the changes they want.</p>

<p>"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Show him to catch fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."</p>
