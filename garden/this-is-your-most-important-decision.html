<p><em>"We believe that what you do with your career is probably the most important ethical decision of your life.<br />
The first reason is the huge amount of time at stake. You have about 80,000 hours in your career: 40 hours per week, 50 weeks per year, for 40 years. That’s more time than you’ll spend eating, socialising, and watching Netflix put together."</em></p>

<p><em>"And that brings us to the second reason why your choice of career is so important: some careers give you the opportunity to do vastly more good for the world than others — to a much greater extent than people realise."</em></p>

<p><em>"We think the impact you can have in different careers is driven by three main factors:</em></p>

<ol>
<li><em>How <strong>pressing the problems are</strong> that you focus on</em></li>
<li><em>The <strong>scale of the contribution</strong> the path lets you make to tackling those problems</em></li>
<li><em>Your <strong>personal fit</strong> for the path"</em></li>
</ol>

<p><em>"The bigger and more neglected an issue is, the greater the chances of an additional person having an impact."</em></p>
