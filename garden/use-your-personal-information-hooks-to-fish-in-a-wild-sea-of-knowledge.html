<div id="content"><p>A bit about hooks</p>

<p>This is a story about you. About your new-found passion. About something you care about so much that it made you switch careers. You and your ideals went all-in, determined to turn this new adventure into something great. But then it happened. Theory overload. All your plans suddenly need to fit into some kind of structure, some framework that other people designed. Bureaucracy all over the place. This is far from what you saw in your shiny visions. Your motivation drops from "take on the world" to "f* this shit". And if you let it, it will destroy your dreams.</p>

<p>Let me make this more concrete with an example. I recently started a new education to become a high school teacher. I've discovered that I get most of my energy out of teaching and coaching the next generation in any area that holds my interest. In this case, learning kids how to code. I embarked on this new adventure with my own ideals in the back of my mind, only to be overloaded by all kinds of structures a teacher has to adhere to. Damn. There goes my positive mindset...</p>

<p>Of course, there is an alternative to climb out of this hole. Something that lets you make sense of the information waves that engulf you. Let's call it a "hook". Like using the correct fishing hook to catch a certain type of fish, you can use your "information hook" to catch only those pieces of information that are relevant for you. Those specific things that align with your vision and dreams. It turns a wild sea into a calm and controlled one, ready to catch the information you're fishing for.</p>

<p>Look at all this new knowledge as an opportunity. See it as a chance for you to strengthen your beliefs and let it confirm your ideas. Use your personal information hooks to fish in a wild sea of knowledge. Your dreams will thank you.</p>
