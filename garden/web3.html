<p>Web 1.0 was about developers creating static, read-only content for others to consume.</p>

<p>Web 2.0 was about consumers being able to produce as well without the need for technical knowledge. The content you produce is not always yours, though, and most of the time it is centralized.</p>

<p>Web 3.0 is about decentralized content and applications, based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain technology</a>. People ensure characteristics like trust and safety with a financial incentive (tokens, or cryptocurrency, often <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a>). There is no third-party involved; people communicate peer-to-peer. </p>
