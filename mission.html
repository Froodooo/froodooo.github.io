<p class="mission-statement">I do what I like and what gives me energy. I challenge myself. I help myself and others grow. Always with respect towards everyone and always independent.</p>

<p>😄 <strong>Fun.</strong> I do activities that are fun and energizing. Which are motivating, both before, during and afterwards. At the end I have more (mental) energy than at the beginning.</p>

<p>🤝 <strong>Respect.</strong> I respect and am respected. For who I am. For what I do. For what I think. Values such as openness, helpfulness and involvement follow from that.</p>

<p>🥊 <strong>Challenge.</strong> I want to be challenged and constantly learn new things. I grow from activities just outside my comfort zone. No growth without challenge. Standing still is going backwards.</p>

<p>🗽 <strong>Independence.</strong> I am in control of my life. I always make my own decisions, without the blocking influence of others.</p>
