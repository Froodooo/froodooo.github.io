<p>😄 <strong>Fun.</strong> I want activities to be fun and energizing. I feel motivation before, during and after activities. I want to finish with more (mental) energy than I started with.</p>

<p>🤝 <strong>Respect.</strong> I want to respect and be respected. For who I am. For what I do. For what I think. Values like openness, helpfulness and involvement will follow from it.</p>

<p>🥊 <strong>Challenge.</strong> I want to be challenged and learn new things constantly. Activities need to be just outside of my comfort zone to make me grow. Without challenge, no growth. Stagnation means decline.</p>

<p>🗽 <strong>Independence</strong> I want to be in control of my life. I want to make my own decisions at any moment and without taking hindering factors from others into account.</p>
