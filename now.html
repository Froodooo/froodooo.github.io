<h2>What I'm doing now.</h2>

<p>⌨️ <strong>Daily job.</strong> I'm a Learning and Development Coach (or Capability Manager, if you like) at <a href="https://www.bettyblocks.com/" target="_blank">Betty Blocks</a>, a platform where people can build complex apps in an easy, fast and fun way. I focus on developing people in the product department, setting up learning paths, supporting step-ups (from junior to mid-level to senior) and assisting in hiring and onboarding new colleagues.</p>

<p>🏃 <strong>Coaching.</strong> I'm a trainer at my local athletics club, coaching 11-15 year old kids towards their competitions and moments of fame. And more importantly, showing them how awesome athletics is.</p>

<p>🧑‍🏫 <strong>Teaching.</strong> I strongly believe in transferring your own knowledge and enthusiasm to the next generation. Therefore I'm a computer science teacher at <a href="https://www.pcc.nu/het-lyceum/" target="_blank">PCC Het Lyceum</a> and mentor at my local <a href="https://coderdojo.com/" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a>.</p>
