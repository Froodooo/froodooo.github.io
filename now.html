<h2>What I'm doing now.</h2>

<p>⌨️ <strong>Work.</strong> <a href="https://www.bettyblocks.com/" target="_blank">Betty Blocks</a> is a platform where anyone can build complex apps in a simple, fast and fun way. Within this company I focus on the development of people within the product department, create learning paths, support promotions (from junior to mid-level to senior) and support the onboarding of new colleagues.</p>

<p>🏃 <strong>Trainer.</strong> I coach 11 to 15 year old athletes at my local athletics club to get the most out of this great sport.</p>

<p>🧑‍🏫 <strong>Teacher.</strong> I strongly believe in transferring your own knowledge and enthusiasm to the next generation. That's why I teach computer science at <a href="https://www.pcc.nu/het-lyceum/" target="_blank">PCC Het Lyceum</a> and support young programmers at the <a href=" https://coderdojo.com/" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a>.</p>
