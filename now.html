<h2>What I'm doing now.</h2>

<p>⌨️ <strong>Daily job.</strong> I'm a developer at <a href="https://www.bettyblocks.com/" target="_blank">Betty
    Blocks</a>, a platform where people can build complex apps in an easy, fast and fun way. I focus on backend work
  mostly, and sometimes also dive into the wondrous frontend world.</p>

<p>🏃 <strong>Coaching.</strong> I'm a youth trainer at my local athletics club, coaching 11-14 year old kids
  towards
  their competitions and moments of fame. And more importantly, showing them how awesome athletics is.</p>

<p>🧑‍🏫 <strong>Teaching.</strong> I strongly believe in transferring your own knowledge and enthusiasm to the
  next
  generation. From that point of view I'm a mentor at my local <a href="https://coderdojo.com/"
    target="_blank">CoderDojo</a>, teaching kids to code. I'm also orienting myself on a career in high school through
  the <a href="https://www.uva.nl/programmas/lerarenopleiding/aan-de-slag-voor-de-klas/aan-de-slag-voor-de-klas.html"
    target="_blank">Aan de Slag voor de Klas</a> program.</p>
